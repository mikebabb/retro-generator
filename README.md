## Getting Started

You'll need an [API key from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/overview) to run this application. Once you have it, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key here>
```

## Running the Application

Back end: `npm run devserver`
Front end: `npm run dev`

With both running, navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the application.
